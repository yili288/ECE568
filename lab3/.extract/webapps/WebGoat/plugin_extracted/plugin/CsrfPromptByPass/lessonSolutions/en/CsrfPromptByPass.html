<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b>Prompt By-Pass with CSRF
<p>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b>
<p>
This lesson teaches how to perform Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks containing 
multiple requests to by-pass a scriptable user-prompt

<p>
<b>General Goal(s):</b>
<p>
Similar to the CSRF Lesson, your goal is to send an email to a newsgroup that contains multiple 
malicious requests: the first request to transfer funds, and the second request to confirm the prompt 
that the first request triggered.  The URLs should point to the attack servlet with this lesson's numeric Screen, menu and with an extra 
parameter "transferFunds=5000", and "transferFunds=CONFIRM". You can copy the shortcut from the 
left hand menu by right clicking on the left hand menu and choosing copy shortcut. Whoever 
receives this email and happens to be authenticated at that time will have his funds transferred. 
When you think the attack is successful, refresh the page and you will find the green check on 
the left hand side menu.
