<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> Phishing with XSS</p>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b><br/>
It is always a good practice to validate all input on the 
server side. XSS can occur when unvalidated user input is used 
in an HTTP response. With the help of XSS you can do a Phishing 
Attack and add content to a page which looks official. It is very 
hard for a victim to determinate that the content is malicious.
