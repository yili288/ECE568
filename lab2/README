### Part 1 - generateQRcode
1. Convert original secret in hex to bytes for passing into base32_encode
2. The original hex is len 20, or 80 bits, or 10 bytes, which becomes len 80/5 = 16 when encoded
3. The final uri is concatenated from the various components via urlEncode where needed

### Part 1 - validateQRcode
1. converts a 20 character hex secret into binary
2. gets current time and create a time interval
3. split the time into 8 bytes
4. apply HMAC = H( (K ⊕ opad) + H((K ⊕ ipad) + M) ) and truncate to get TOTP value

### Part 2 - Mobile Multi-Factor Authentication
API for user logins with mobile two-factor authentication. Communicates with the device to check for account registration, send authentication requests and check for authentication status.
