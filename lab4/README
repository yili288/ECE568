Part 2 Explanation:
We need to be able to modify the NS records in the DNS response packet, so we loop through the packet. 
A socket is also initialized to receive DNS queries, and we forward the query to the BIND server. 

Part 3 Explanation:
To spoof the DNS reply, we change various parameters of the DNS packet and send the modified response back to the original requester. 

Part 4 Explanation:
Making use of the core functionality from the exampleSendDNSQuery function, we first send a DNS query to the nameserver after the socket is initialized. 
Then, we send a bunch of fake replies, setting a large enough TTL of 3600 and attempting with various random TX ID values.
